## Introduction 
For the Final Project, we wanted to look into online shopper purchasing intentions whenever the customer opens an online website and what factors go into increasing or decreasing the probability of a direct purchase.

- Proposed project timeline: When do you expect to have your dataset loaded into R? When do you expect to start your analysis?

- Simple overview of the dataset. What does the dataset document? How do you plan to collect it? (Is it a simple download, a webscrape, etc? Provide a citation.) How big is the dataset? What kinds of variables will you be dealing with? Any missingness? Do you need to join two or more sources of data together?

- Description of potential research questions. Are they predictive or inferential? (Should be predictive questions!) Are these questions best answered by a classification or regression-based approach? What is the response variable? 

- Which variables do you suspect will be useful in modeling the response? Any difficulties you may encounter along the way: Is the data collection mechanism complicated? Is there significant missingness in the data?
